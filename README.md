# PyArmadillo
**PyArmadillo: an alternative approach to linear algebra in Python**

PyArmadillo is a linear algebra library for the Python language, with an emphasis on ease of use. It aims to
provide a high-level syntax and functionality deliberately similar to Matlab/Octave, allowing mathematical
operations to be expressed in a familiar and natural manner. PyArmadillo provides objects for matrices and
cubes, as well as over 200 associated functions for manipulating data stored in the objects. All functions are
accessible in one flat structure. Integer, floating point and complex numbers are supported. Various matrix
factorisations are provided through integration with LAPACK, or one of its high performance drop-in
replacements such as Intel MKL or OpenBLAS.

While frameworks such as NumPy and SciPy are available for Python, they tend to be unnecessarily
verbose and cumbersome to use from a linear algebra point of view. These frameworks require users to handle
data types that are not immediately intuitive, have a structure that complicates the use of common functions,
and use syntax that considerably differs from Matlab.
