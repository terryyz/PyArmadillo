# PyArmadillo
**PyArmadillo: an alternative approach to linear algebra in Python**
**This library is co-led by [Jason Rumengan](https://www.jasonrumengan.my.id), me and [Conrad Sanderson](https://conradsanderson.id.au).**

## Installation
* Currently, PyArmadillo only supports `pip`. But we will support `conda` in the next step.
* The installation process is much easier as a precompiled version of PyArmadillo is available via the Python Package Index (PyPI).
* Use the following command for installation:  
`pip3 install --user pyarma`  
 or  
`pip3 install pyarma`  
* If pip3 cannot be found, try using the following alternatives:

 * `python3 -m pip`
 * `py -m pip`
* To upgrade PyArmadillo via pip:  
`pip3 install --upgrade --user pyarma`  
or  
`pip3 install --upgrade pyarma`  
**NOTE**: It's possible that pip may erroneously not find the newest version. In that case, try the following command:  
`pip3 install --no-cache-dir --upgrade --user pyarma`  
or  
`pip3 install --no-cache-dir --upgrade pyarma`  

## FAQ
* Why do we choose Gitlab as our codebase?
  * We choose GitLab, as Microsoft has acquired GitHub.
  * Microsoft is a nefarious entity with a long and consistent history of [unconscionable & unethical behaviour](https://jacquesmattheij.com/what-is-wrong-with-microsoft-buying-github).
  * **_I still consider Github as a lovely community and hence will update the code package here when the new version comes_ :D**
